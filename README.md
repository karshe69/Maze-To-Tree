Maze-To-Tree
About
Welcome to Maze-To-Tree!
Have you heard of tree-to-list?
Well, from (not) the same creator comes the next big thing: Maze-to-Tree!

This project takes the structure of a maze and converts it into a tree structure, allowing for easier traversal, analysis, and manipulation of maze paths.

Features
 - Convert a maze into a tree-based structure for easy traversal.

 - Generate mazes using five different algorithms:

   - Recursive Backtracker

   - Kruskal's Algorithm

   - Prim's Algorithm

   - Eller's Algorithm

   - Binary Tree Maze Generation

 - Solve mazes efficiently using the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm.

 - Written entirely in Java.

Prerequisites
 - Java 8 or later

 - Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or simply use javac and java from the terminal.

Acknowledgments
 - Maze generation techniques inspired by algorithems from wikipedia

 - Maze solving inspired by the A* (A-star) pathfinding algorithm.

Thanks to the developer community for inspiration and algorithmic foundations!
